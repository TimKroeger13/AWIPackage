\usage{
MaxKorrelation(main, folder, thick, offset, IgnorePercent = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{main}{Vector from FolderCreater.}

\item{folder}{Folder structur to calculate all values from.}

\item{thick}{Thickness of age intervals to interpolate to.}

\item{offset}{Size of the area in which all correlations are calculated. must be dividable by the thickness!}

\item{IgnorePercent}{Change this values carefully. Specifies a minimum percentage of the read data that should not be NA.}
}
\value{
Returns a Dataframe with all Min and Max value for each element of the FOlder structure.
}
\description{
Calculates all Max and Min values for an Folder structure.

This function has only been developed for the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research and should therefore only be used in combination with their database.
